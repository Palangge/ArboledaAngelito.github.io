          <b>My journey as a KodeGo student began when my sister referred me to the program while I was searching for a job. 
            At first, I questioned the need to learn how to code, but I soon realized the growing demand for web developers in the current digital age. 
            Seeing the potential benefits, I decided to apply for KodeGo, 
            and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that they also assist their students in securing job opportunities as web developers. 
            As a student, I am now learning to code and enjoying the experience of experimenting with my work. 
            It's not just about gaining knowledge, but also having fun along the way.
