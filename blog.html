      <p><b>My journey as a KodeGo student began when my sister referred me to the program while I was searching for a job. At first, I questioned the need to learn how to code, but I soon realized the growing demand for web developers in the current digital age. Seeing the potential benefits, I decided to apply for KodeGo, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that they also assist their students in securing job opportunities as web developers. As a student, I am now learning to code and enjoying the experience of experimenting with my work. It's not just about gaining knowledge, but also having fun along the way.</b></H4></p>
